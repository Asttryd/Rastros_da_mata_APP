# Rastros da Mata


The project's intention is to motivate people to plant their own fruits, greens, vegetables and herbs in an attempt to, not only help people have more healthy eating choices, but to:

- help on what they choose to buy in the grocery store;

- teach people (especially, but not limited to kids) on how they can grow their own food at home;

- Encourage people to have more healthy and balanced meals

- help reduce the quantity of pesticide used to make the plants grow, making life quality increase, even if just by a little bit!

This project covers 2 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

2: Zero Hunger
3: Good Health and Wellbeing

This project was initialized by March 17th, therefore, there's a lot of room for improvement that we would like to work on while in this challenge.

One of the difficulties we found while developing was that we tried to make an API to add the info to a database so we could make a smooth experience, but unfortunately, we didn't find any solutions that could financially work for us, so we implemented the database directly into the code instead.

We received some feedback about the application and the ones that has the constructive critiques are, mostly, about the colors in the interface and about how the android app delays and can crash very easily.

The User interface is fixed, and we're working on fixing the crashing and delaying issue.

# ABOUT THE DEVELOPERS:

Asttryd S. P.

Developed the android app using the flutter framework and Hive for the local database.

# WARNING:
The application as of now, Is still in Portuguese (Brazil), but there will be additions to adapt it to English as well.

# How to get the application

First, you gotta make sure that you have flutter installed in your machine (the final app is still under analisis at playstore)

Then, build the apk and install it in your mobile device, or simply run it inside a Code editor without debugging.

# How would the user navigate through the app?

Initial page: that's where the app launches at, and gives a warm welcome and a brief sentence explaining what the app is for.

About page: Assuming the person doesn't understand fully the concept of the app, they'll go directly to a page that has more information about it and absorb as much information as possible, so they know what it is for, and if they downloaded what they were looking for.

Plants: after that, they'll most likely want to see what's in store for them, what they could learn, and take a look at all the information that is at their disposal.

When they click on a plant: Once the person finds what they are looking for, after clicking on it, it will display a whole page of information about it, such as:
  - How much sunlight can it get
  - How many days will it take to develop itself
  - How many days will it take to be ready to harvest
  - What's the frequency needed to water them
  - Any important information about that specific plant
  - How to plant it
  - How to replant it, if necessary.
  
  
Contact: If the person doesn't find what they're looking for, or has suggestions for the projects, they can go to the contact page and choose the method of communication: whatsapp, gmail or instagram, and send their thoughts directly to us.
